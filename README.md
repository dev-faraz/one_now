# 1Now backend api

- # What 1Now Does
    - 1Now builds digital tools that help small and independent car rental companies manage their daily operations. These tools include online booking systems, vehicle fleet management, rental agreements, calendar views, and payment integration â€” effectively modernizing car rental businesses with cloud-based solutions.

- # Who 1Now Serves
    - 1Now primarily serves small to mid-sized local rental agencies, such as LahoreCarRental.com, who often lack the resources to build and maintain custom tech stacks. These operators need simple, reliable backend systems to support their operations and customer bookings.

- # How This Backend Connects to LahoreCarRental.com Frontend
    - his Django REST API serves as the backend engine powering LahoreCarRental.com. The frontend, which could be built in any modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular), will connect to this backend through HTTP requests to the exposed REST endpoints.
